# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📘 Overview

This project aims to predict house prices using the **Ames Housing dataset**.
It was developed as my **first machine learning project**, focusing on understanding the complete data science workflow — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training and evaluation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Explore and understand housing data using **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
* Handle missing values and categorical variables effectively
* Build and compare multiple **regression models**
* Evaluate performance using standard metrics like **R² Score**, **MAE**, and **RMSE**

---

## 🧩 Dataset

* **Dataset:** Ames Housing Dataset
* Contains various features such as lot size, year built, overall quality, garage type, and more
* Available on [Kaggle: Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prevek18/ames-housing-dataset)

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

---

## 🧠 Model Building Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing:**

   * Handled missing values
   * Encoded categorical variables
   * Normalized numeric features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

   * Visualized relationships between features and sale price
   * Identified key factors influencing housing costs

3. **Model Implementation:**

   * Linear Regression
   * Ridge Regression
   * Random Forest Regressor

4. **Model Evaluation:**

   * Compared performance using R² Score, MAE, and RMSE

---

## 📈 Results

* The Random Forest model provided the best performance among all tested models.
* Key features like **Overall Quality**, **Living Area**, and **Garage Cars** showed strong influence on price prediction.
